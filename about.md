My name is [Dru Sellers](http://drusellers.com). I am a coder and an exerciser for time.

By day I work as a Software Architect for [MAG](http://maggroup.com) focusing on the backend fulfillment systems, when I'm not at work I'm either reading, coding or spending too much time at [the gym](http://karhustrength.com). 

I'm starting this project because I've been inspired by some many who have shared [their](http://www.dunaj.org) [own](http://buffer.com) [adventures](http://huboard.com). 

Specifically though, I am curious as well about how we can start to apply more metrics (ala [Money Ball](http://www.amazon.com/Moneyball-The-Winning-Unfair-Game-ebook/dp/B000RH0C8G)) to the sport.
