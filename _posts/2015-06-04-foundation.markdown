#Platforms for support

So this is mostly my own hang up but I need to have a solid idea of how I am going to build this thing. One of my biggest questions I go back and forth on is should I build this application on [Heroku](http://heroku.com) (I really do love them) or do I build the application on [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com)? I like them both quite a bit, but granted I like them for different reasons. So, instead of just sprinting ahead and picking one I am forcing myself to take a few minutes to sit down and reason out why I should choose one over the other.

##Control

###AWS

What I like about Amazon is it gives me bare metal support. If I want to take one server and slap PostgreSQL, Neo4j, and 3 applications on it - I can. It will cost me some money (as much as I love the calulator I have no idea how much I would spend) but I'll have the full control.

###Heroku

Ok, so I don't have full control, but I get so much more application level monitoring and hosting support, that as a solo entrepreneur it seems silly to under value how much less ops time I will have to spend. Choosing Heroku lets me "focus on the app" - which at this early stage is not a bad way to think. I could have neo4j up and running on a free instance today as well as a postgres instance (which means I also get all of the cool Heroku PG Goodness).
