#Where do you start?

So here I am reading about how [Baremetric got their first 100 customers](https://baremetrics.com/blog/first-100-customers) and I'm wondering "Am I actually solving a pain point?" or am I just going off half-cocked again? It definitely wouldn't be the first time I have done that. :) 

Ok, so what is the pain point I am trying to solve? Well I have a few that I am thinking of that I know we have as a pain point for our team. The biggest one is team metrics. I know for sure that one of the big players out there just is not meating the needs of our competitive team. It lacks the ability to easily enter scores and workouts that are structured the way coach does them. But how much are boxes really going to pay for an additional service? Even if every team that goes to the games purchased my software at $99/month times 40 teams that's $3,960 MMR. Not sure I could ever hit $5,000MMR let alone $10,000MMR. But if I could take on a whole box management SaaS play. Well then it would get interesting.

Another idea I had was to solve a business metrics problem for [Shopify](http://shopify.com) much like [baremetric](http://baremetrics.com) did for [stripe](http://stripe.com) but I'm not really sure I have any new ideas that the [existing applications](https://apps.shopify.com/categories/reporting) don't provide already.

Ok, so I'm not 100% sure on my idea. But I can get started on the fact that I know I want a SaaS play so I can start building the money system. I've never built it before and I've been told its quite interesting.
