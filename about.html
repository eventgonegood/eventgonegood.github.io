My name is Dru Sellers. I am a coder and an exerciser for time. As a coder I often like to think about how I would model certain things. Also, as I watch my gym team progress to the games, I wonder if I could help analyze the game better.

Inspried by Money Ball, and the http://www.dunaj.org/ project. For how the author took so much time to lay out his thoughts and present it in a beautiful way.

I train at CrossFit Jaakarhu
